<p><h3><center>C Language - Overview</center></h3></p>
<p> C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs.<br />
 C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.<br />
 

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.<br />

The UNIX operating system, the C compiler,<br />
 and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons -<br />

Easy to learn<br />
Structured language<br />
It produces efficient programs<br />
It can handle low-level activities<br />
It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms<br />
Facts about C
C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.<br />

C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.<br />

The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).<br />

The UNIX OS was totally written in C.<br />

Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.<br />

Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.<br />

Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.<br />

Why use C?<br />
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system.<br /> C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be -<br />

Operating Systems<br />
Language Compilers<br />
Assemblers<br />
Text Editors<br />
Print Spoolers<br />
Network Drivers<br />
Modern Programs<br />
Databases<br />
Language Interpreters<br />
Utilities<br />
C Programs<br />
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c";<br /> for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.

This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.</p>
